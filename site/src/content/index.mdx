## Styled to match your brand identity

Your business already has an identity, including the colours and logo you put on your business cards and your building. I design your website’s style to follow your style. 

## Search Engine Optimisation

Your site will be built to Google’s recommendations for usability and code structure, so you get proper exposure on Google and Bing.

## Updating your website’s content is easy

You can email me content updates at any time and I’ll update the site you you. You’ll also get logins for you and your authorised staff members to make edits yourself.

## Solid and secure hosting

Your site will be secure with weekly backups, regular security updates, reliable Australian servers, and an SSL certificate to protect your users’ privacy.

## Google Analytics

Google Analytics shows you statistics for your website’s visitor traffic. I give you access to your site’s analytics so you can measure your website’s performance.
